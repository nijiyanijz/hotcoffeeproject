        <h2>Coffee Trends</h2>

            <h4>Snapchilled coffee</h4>
            <img src="./galleryimg/images (9).jfif">
            <p>If you enjoyed the cold brew movement, then you will love snapchilled coffee. Snapchilling is a process
                developed by MIT alumnus David Dussault, He developed a process to reduce the temperature of coffee from
                very hot to extremely cold in a couple of minutes.Snapchilled coffee is arguably superior to cold brew
                as it does a better job of extracting flavour from
                the coffee bean, while still producing a brew that is smooth and less acidic.
                It’s the best of both
                worlds, really.As soon as temperatures rise, many of us divide into two opposing camps: team cold brew,
                and team iced coffee. To throw this rivalry into flux, Elemental Beverage Co., a coffee company based
                out of the greater Boston area, is introducing a third option to the mix: team snapchilled.</p>

            <h4>Dalgona Coffee</h4>
            <img src="./galleryimg/images (10).jfif">
            <p>Dalgona coffee burst onto the scene in early 2020 via TikTok. It is a Korean whipped coffee made from
                instant coffee, sugar, water, and milk. Although it is simple in terms of ingredients, the beautifully
                fluffy whipped coffee top is really attention-grabbing and delicious.

                Creative TikTok users began to make variations on dalgona coffee using chai, pumpkin spice, gelato,
                liqueurs, and other ingredients. Here’s a short video showing how to make the original.The name
                “Dalgona”, under which it is most popularly known, comes from the Korean “달구나”, which translates roughly
                to “it's sweet”, and is also the name used for a honeycomb toffee snack sold by street vendors in Korea,
                which the sweet foam of the drink is said to recall.</p>

            <h4>Buttered Coffee</h4>
            <img src="./galleryimg/download (14).jfif">
            <p>Adding butter to coffee is a growing trend amongst celebrities and athletes looking to get a little more
                kick out of their cup of joe. Although some people claim it magically adds more nutrients, Healthline
                reports that it simply adds some vitamin A and a lot of saturated fat. But why not give it a go, you
                might like the taste!.Butter coffee is a drink consisting of brewed coffee, unsalted butter, and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), an easily digested type of fat. It's similar to Bulletproof coffee, which was developed by an entrepreneur named Dave Asprey.</p>
